# Hello, I'm Amanda da Costa üòÅ

I'm a new (starter haha) fullstack developer, looking to create technologies to help people in a constructive way. I'm passionate about games, music, and also to create new apps accessible to all people. The technologies I most enjoy using are ReactJS, JamStack (Javascript, API's, Markup). Still learning about the best stacks, and I intend to show my work in a constructive way so that I can help other people walk the same way as I do, to reach my final goal. I am interested in showing that women are also capable of revolutionizing the world of tech, and I hope that the girls who are starting out, like me, do not give up on their dreams.

  <br/> :black_heart: &nbsp; looking to colaborate in projects (Front-end using React)
 <br/> :computer: &nbsp; Learning stacks: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript React, ReactJS, Node.js, React Native & TypeScript.
 <br/> üí¨  &nbsp; About me: Love Technologies, games like Fortnite and GTAV, movies and tv shows.
